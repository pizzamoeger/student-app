class edit should lead back to classes (navigate up)
    customize navigate up arrow
    when navigating to smt from popup menu first navigate back to fragment thingy ("close")
    as i want to exit class edit when nav in bottom view and when going back to classes it should go to classes not to calss edit
- same for event edit
- same for assignmetn edit
timetable to day view: navigate back does not do what it should
