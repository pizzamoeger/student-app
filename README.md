# Student App

This is an android app meant for students.

The app has multiple key features:
* managing your classes
* tracking your study time
* managing your timetable
* managing your assignments
* managing your semesters
* managing your grades
* creating an account to access your data from different devices
* (more to be added)

Each feature will be explained in detail below.

## Managing your classes

If you open the app, the `Classes Fragment` is launched.
Initially, you will just see one button `+ ADD CLASS`.

If you click on this button, a new View will be opened (`Class Edit`).
Here, you can name your class and assign a color to it. You can also just use the provided (random) color and name.
You can exit this View in two ways:
* If you decide against adding that class, you have to press the `DELETE`-Button.
* If you want to add the class, you can press the `SAVE`-Button.
Both will lead you back to the `Classes Fragment`-View.

If you added one or more classes, they will be listed in the `Classes Fragment`-View.
You can edit any of those classes by clicking on the corresponding pen-icon located at the right.
